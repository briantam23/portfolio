                Before graduating from Fullstack Academy, I was an analyst but soon discovered it did not offer enough ways to express myself in my work. From exploring Fullstackâ€™s preparatory course, I realized how much I loved the analytical yet creative aspect that is unique to computer programming. Moreover, with the tech industry booming and our lives becoming increasingly revolved around tech, I want to get in on the action and create the next best thing. For my next role, I am looking for a mentorship program in addition to pair programming and an open environment.
